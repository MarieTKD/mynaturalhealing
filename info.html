            <p>
                Since I was a teenager, I've been very prone to tendinitis while doing physical exercises. 
                When I started martial arts about 7 years ago, the plague came back, and about 6 months in, I got tendinitis in both hamstrings. 
                I decided to stop eating gluten to help lower the inflammation. A couple month later, I tried eating pasta and bread and after about 48h, 
                I could feel the heat where my body had weaknesses. It even woke me up at night. A big burst of inflammation... so I stopped gluten completely.<br>
            
                I am also lactose intolerant. I eat cheese sometimes (on pizzas) with lactase pills (Lactaid).<br><br>

                Shortly after starting martial arts, I also reduced my sugar intake to lose weight. I had trouble digesting sugar anyway. 
                I loved the results: I lost almost 20 pounds, I had a lot more energy, and my brain felt like a curtain of fog had just lifted. 
                I usually don't eat food containing more than 5g of sugar (or not the whole thing in one setting).<br><br>

                Recently, I've been feeling more and more pain in my body. My hands started hurting a lot, my feet as well (I can't walk well when I wake up in the morning), 
                my hips and knees started hurting again and in general, the level of inflammation is up. 
                 Part of it is due to not respecting my diet as strictly during my recent vacation.<br><br>

                My brother has rheumatoid arthritis and manage the disease following the Seignalet diet, 
                which focused on eliminating toxins from our food. It's a pretty restrictive way of eating that removes almost all cereals, 
                dairy (from all animals), pre-made food and junk food. 
                High temperature cooking, like BBQ, roasting, frying, especially for meat, is prohibited. 
                The result, however, is the disappearance of pain, the recovery of mobility and, sometimes, remission!<br><br>

                In this blog, I will talk about my journey following this diet, what seems to work for me, what doesn't. 
                I will try to plan my meals and share it with you.<br><br>

                It's important to remember a few things:<br>

                <strong class="rule">I am not a doctor, just a person trying to heal herself using natural products<br>
                Everyone is different, what works for me may not work for you and vice-versa<br>
                Talk to your doctor before making important changes in your diet or taking supplements</strong>
